        <article id="bar">While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar 
                    system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of 
                    the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.
                    Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.
                    The name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for
                    our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun. <br> <br>

           <p class="top">Namesake</p>
           <article class="down">The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek 
                    and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</article>
                    <p class="top">Potential for Life</p>
                    <article class="down">Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.
                         Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the 
                         temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided 
                         a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago. <br> <br>

                        Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing 
                        effects of climate change.</article>
                        <p class="top">Size and Distance</p>
                        <article class="down">With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial
                             planets and the fifth largest planet in our solar system. 

                            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical 
                            unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the 
                            Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun. 
                            
                            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</article>
                            <p class="top">Orbit and Rotation</p>
                            <article class="down">
                                As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete 
                                one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, 
                                which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the 
                                Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called 
                                a leap year. <br> <br>

                                Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around 
                                the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere 
                                is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, 
                                solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter
                                 in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres 
                                 receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.

                           <article class="down">
                            Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the
                             outer core, mantle, and crust. The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 
                             miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit 
                             (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles 
                             (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids. <br><br>In between the outer core and crust is the 
                             mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers)
                              thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles
                               (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends 
                               about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.

                            <article class="down">
                                Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which includes 
                                the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are
                                 constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin,
                                  roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past 
                                  one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate. <br><br>Earth's 
                                  global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles 
                                  (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth's water. Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under
                                   these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most 
                                   of it is underwater. Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic 
                                   and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.</article>

                            <article class="down">
                                Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other 
                                gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and 
                                short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. 
                                It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in
                                 the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.

            <aside class="down"> 
                Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the 
                night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's 
                wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years. <br>
                
                Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically trapped by Earth's 
                gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in
                 a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun. <br>
                
                Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result 
                of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into 
                it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. 
                With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system
                 (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, and Io). <br>
                
                The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized 
                planets could fit in between Earth and its Moon.</aside>
