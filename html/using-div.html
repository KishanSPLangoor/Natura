            <p style="font-size: 130%;">Remembering Who I Am</p>
                
                <p style="padding-right: 800px;">Have the demands of life made you forget who you are and what you are capable of? Whether
                    it’s navigating your career, marriage, relationships, singlehood, motherhood, family dynamics, 
                    aging, caregiving, health challenges, grief, or any of life’s other complexities that have
                     left you in need of a reset — remember, YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
                   Join us on August 23-25, 2024 for a transformational journey in the North Georgia Mountains, 
                   where we will silence the “shoulds” and “have tos” and “what ifs” to hear the voice that
                    has been silenced for far too long. . . your own.</p>
